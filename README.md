# WK1 Challenge Code Refactor

## Description

This application is built to reinforce the concepts presented in the Coding Bootcamp, week 1. The goal of the
challenge is to make an existing code more accessible by adding alt text to images which are picked up by screen readers for the visually impared. Additionally, the HTML was edited to apply correct semantic HTML and 
comments to make the code easier to understand. Lastly, the CSS was edited to be more concise and organized with comments explaining the result of style choices.

## Original User Story and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
